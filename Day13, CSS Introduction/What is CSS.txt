What is CSS?

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to format the layout of a webpage.

With CSS, you can control the color, font, size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

Using CSS

CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
.Inline - by using the style attribute inside the HTML elements
.Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
.External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file


Inline in CSS
<h1 style = "color-blue;"> A blue heading</h1>

Internal in CSS

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {background-color: powderblue;}
h1   {color: blue;}
p    {color: red;}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>


External in CSS


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
