How To Make an HTML List?

In web design, there are 3 different types of list which you may wish to add to your site.

Ordered List

The first is an <OL>, an ordered content list. For example:

1. An item
2. Another item
3. Another goes here.


Inside the <ol> tag we list each item on the list inside <li> </li> tags.

E.G.:
<ol>
<li> An item</li>
<li> Another item</li>
<li> Another goes here</li>

</ol>

Unordered List

The second type of list that you may wish to include is an <ul> unordered list.
This is better known as a bullet point list and contains no numbers

<ul> 
<li> An item</li>
<li> Another item</li>
<li> Another goes here</li>

</ul>


Definition List:

Finally, you may wish to include a definition list <dl> on you page. An example of <dl> list is as follows:

<dl> 
<dt> Item</dt>
<dd> The definition goes here</dd>
</dl>




Table: Another way to keep your website looking neat and orderly is through the use of a table.


What Does a Table Consist Of?

When drawing a table we must open an element with <table> opening tag.
Inside this tag, we structure the table using the table rows, <tr>, and cells, <td>.



E.G.:
<table> 
<tr>
 <td>Row 1 - Column 1</td>
 <td>Row 1 - Colunm 2 </td>
 <td>Row 1 - Column 3 </td> 
</tr>
 <tr> 
<td>Row 2 - Column 1</td> 
<td>Row 2 - Column 2</td> 
<td>Row 2 - Column 3</td>
 </tr>
 </table>
