The Method Attribute:
The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data.

The form data can be sent as URL variable with method = "Get" or as an HTTP post transaction with method ="post".

The default HTTP method when submitting the form data is GET.

Notes on GET:
Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
Never use GET to send sensitive data! (The submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result.
GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in GOOGLE


Note on POST:
Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
Post has no size limitation and can be used to send large amounts of data
Form submission with POST cannot be bookmarked.


The Nonvalidate Attribute
The nonvalidate attribute is a Boolean attribute.
When present, it specifies that the form-data(input) should not be validated when submitted.
