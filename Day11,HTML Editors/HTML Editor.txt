Creating Your First HTML Webpage
In the ground up, you need to open your THML editor, where you will find a clean white page on which to write your code.

Basic Construction of an HTML Page
These tags should be placed underneath each other at the top of every HTML page that you create.

<!Doctype HTML>: Tells the browser that you used the HTML5.

<html>: This tag signals that from here on we are going to write in HTML code.

<head> This is where all the metadata for the page goes - stuff mostly meant for search engines and other computer programs.

<body>: This is where the content of the page goes.

<meat> This is where information about the document is stored: character encoding, name(page context), and description.

HTML Heading: 
In HTML, headings are written in the following elements:
<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>

Creating Your Heading: 
<h1> Welcome to my page.</h1>


How to add text in HTML:
Adding text to our HTML page is simple using an element opened with the tag <p> which creates a new paragraph. We place all of our regular text inside the element <p>

<p>topic about earth. </p>

Other key elements:
<b> = bold
<strong> = strong
<i> = Italic
<em> Emphasized Text
<mark> = Mark Text: highlight the background of the text
<small> = Small text: To shrink the text
<strike> = Struck out Text: To place a horizontal line across the text
<u> = Underlined text: 
<ins> = Inserted text: Displayed with an underline to show an inserted text
<sub> = Subscript text: Typographical Stylistic Choice
<sup> = Superscript text: Another typographical presentation style


E.G.: <p> Welcome to <em>MY</em> brand new website This site will be my <strong>new </strong> home on the web. </p>


How to add links in HTML: Always everything you click on while surfing the web is a link that takes you to another page within the website you are visiting or to an external site.

The Anchor Tag: The <a> (or anchor) opening tag is written in the format:
<a href = "https: //blogging.com/how-to-start-a-blog/">Your link text here </a>

In today's modern digital world, images are everything. The <img> tag has everything you need to display images on your site. <img> tag contains attributes as the anchor tag.
